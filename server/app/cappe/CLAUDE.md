# Cappe backend

Website builder + domain reselling for the consumer brand **Gummfit** (gummfit.com). Own product — not a matcha tenant. See root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Repo layout — products map" and "Custom products" sections for where this fits among the other products; this file only covers what's specific to working inside `server/app/cappe/`.

For domain-reselling ops (Porkbun, Stripe platform account, go-live checklist), see `DOMAINS.md` in this directory — don't duplicate that content here.

## Identity & boundary

- Own identity model: `cappe_accounts` table, JWT `scope=cappe`. **Not** `users`/`companies` — no tenant model shared with Matcha.
- Mounted at `/api/cappe` (+ an unprefixed tenant renderer on `*.gummfit.com`).
- **Import rule**: `cappe/` imports only from `app/core/*` (shared db pool, email, storage, auth, redis). Verified 2026-07-27: `cappe → matcha` is 0 edges. Don't add one — grep the root CLAUDE.md's cross-product import rule before reaching for a matcha service.

## Layout

- `routes/` — HTTP layer
- `services/` — business logic (Porkbun client, Stripe Connect, site rendering, etc.)
- `models/` — Pydantic shapes
- `dependencies.py` — `scope=cappe` JWT auth dep

## Frontend pairing

Paired frontend lives at `client/src/cappe/` (own `CLAUDE.md` there).

## Cross-cutting rules

DB safety rules, test-data email domain rules, and deploy rules are in root `CLAUDE.md` — they apply here unchanged, not restated.

## Ops invariants (2026-09 audit)

- **Every scheduled Cappe task needs three things or it silently never runs:** its module in
  `workers/celery_app.py` `include` (Celery builds the consumer's strategy map *before*
  `worker_ready` fires, so a module imported lazily at dispatch time is "unregistered" and the
  message is dropped), a `_SCHEDULED_TASKS` entry, and a `scheduler_settings` row seeded by a
  migration (`zzzzcappe30`/`zzzzcappe31` are the shape — the admin UI can toggle rows but never
  inserts them). `tests/workers/test_celery_scheduler_dispatch.py` pins the first two.
- **Custom domains are served through CloudFront distribution tenants, not the EC2 directly.**
  `cappe_sites.custom_domain` is written only by `cappe_edge_sync` once the tenant's managed
  certificate is `live`; registration/verification only sets `cappe_domains.edge_status`.
  Feature is gated by `CAPPE_CUSTOM_DOMAINS_ENABLED` until the AWS side in
  `docs/ops/CAPPE_CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md` exists. Flow + runbook: `DOMAINS.md`.
- **Consumer PII lives in Cappe's own tables** — `scripts/sql/anonymize_dev.sql` block 8 scrubs
  them and `refresh-dev-from-prod.sh` gates on them; a new email/token column on a `cappe_*`
  table must be added to both.
- **Money-path webhooks gate on `payment_status == "paid"`** (`routes/payments.py`,
  `routes/domains.py`); `async_payment_succeeded/failed` and `session.expired` are handled and the
  abandoned-order reaper (`cappe_order_reaper`) is the backstop for restocking.
