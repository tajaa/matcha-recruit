# Cappe backend

Website builder + domain reselling for the consumer brand **Gummfit** (gummfit.com). Own product — not a matcha tenant. See root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Repo layout — products map" and "Custom products" sections for where this fits among the other products; this file only covers what's specific to working inside `server/app/cappe/`.

For domain-reselling ops (Porkbun, Stripe platform account, go-live checklist), see `DOMAINS.md` in this directory — don't duplicate that content here.

## Identity & boundary

- Own identity model: `cappe_accounts` table, JWT `scope=cappe`. **Not** `users`/`companies` — no tenant model shared with Matcha.
- Mounted at `/api/cappe` (+ an unprefixed tenant renderer on `*.gummfit.com`).
- **Import rule**: `cappe/` imports only from `app/core/*` (shared db pool, email, storage, auth, redis). Verified 2026-07-27: `cappe → matcha` is 0 edges. Don't add one — grep the root CLAUDE.md's cross-product import rule before reaching for a matcha service.

## Layout

- `routes/` — HTTP layer
- `services/` — business logic (Porkbun client, Stripe Connect, site rendering, etc.)
- `models/` — Pydantic shapes
- `dependencies.py` — `scope=cappe` JWT auth dep

## Frontend pairing

Paired frontend lives at `client/src/cappe/` (own `CLAUDE.md` there).

## Cross-cutting rules

DB safety rules, test-data email domain rules, and deploy rules are in root `CLAUDE.md` — they apply here unchanged, not restated.
