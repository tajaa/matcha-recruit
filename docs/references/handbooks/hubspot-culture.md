# HubSpot Culture Code

### The HEART Acronym
Employees should be:
*   **H**umble
*   **E**mpathetic
*   **A**daptable
*   **R**emarkable
*   **T**ransparent

### Core Principles
1.  **Solve For The Customer:** The customer's needs come before the company's metrics.
2.  **Maniacal About Metrics:** Use data to drive decisions and measure success.
3.  **Radical Transparency:** Share information broadly and trust employees with it.
4.  **Autonomy & Ownership:** Give people the freedom to do their best work.
5.  **Work + Life, not Work vs. Life:** Focus on flexibility and long-term sustainability.
6.  **Good Judgment:** Instead of complex rules, rely on the "use good judgment" guideline.
