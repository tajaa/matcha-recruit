# USHG: Enlightened Hospitality

### 1. The Virtuous Cycle
The core of the Union Square Hospitality Group (Danny Meyer) philosophy is that the most important stakeholders are the **employees**.
*   **Prioritization Order:** 1. Employees -> 2. Guests -> 3. Community -> 4. Suppliers -> 5. Investors.
*   **Logic:** If you take care of your team, they will take care of the guests, which leads to business success.

### 2. Family Values (5Cs)
USHG hires and reviews employees based on these five characteristics:
*   **C**haracter: Integrity and ethics.
*   **C**ompetence: The ability to do the job.
*   **C**ompassion: Empathy for colleagues and guests.
*   **C**uriosity: A desire to learn and grow.
*   **C**ommitment: Passion for the craft of hospitality.

### 3. Policy Innovation: Hospitality Included
USHG was a pioneer in "Hospitality Included" (eliminating tipping in favor of higher base wages), though they later adjusted this based on market dynamics. This remains a key case study for restaurant wage policy.
