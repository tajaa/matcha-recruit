*   **Optimism & Affirmation:** Creating a workspace where employees feel valued and positive.
*   **Continuous Learning:** A strong focus on mentorship and leadership development.
*   **Shack Tracks:** Defined career paths allowing employees to move from "Team Member" to "General Manager."

### 4. Diversity & Community
*   **DEI Goals:** Specific targets for diversity in leadership roles.
*   **Neighborhood Outreach:** Each Shack partners with local charities and participates in neighborhood events.
