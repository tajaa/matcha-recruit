# GitLab Values (CREDIT)

### 1. Collaboration
*   Working together effectively across time zones.
*   Kindness and open feedback.
*   No ego; focus on the best idea, not who it came from.

### 2. Results
*   Focus on output, not hours worked.
*   Measuring what matters and delivering value to users.
*   Personal responsibility for outcomes.

### 3. Efficiency
*   Working smarter, not just harder.
*   Boring solutions (simple is better).
*   Optimizing processes and minimizing waste.

### 4. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging
*   Global-first mindset.
*   Creating a safe space for everyone to contribute.
*   Active efforts to include underrepresented groups.

### 5. Iteration
*   The minimum viable change.
*   Fast feedback loops.
*   Reducing the scope of any given change to speed up learning.

### 6. Transparency
*   "Public by default."
*   Sharing everything (plans, challenges, metrics) unless there's a security/privacy reason not to.
*   Direct communication.
