# Starbucks Partner Guide: The "Partner" Model

### 1. The "Partner" Philosophy
Starbucks refers to all employees as "Partners." This is more than a title; it represents a commitment to mutual success. Even part-time partners (working 20+ hours) are eligible for full benefits, including health insurance and stock options (Bean Stock).

### 2. The "Third Place" Concept
The primary policy goal is to create a "Third Place"—a warm and welcoming environment between home and work.
*   **Welcoming Environment:** Policies focus on inclusion and creating a sense of belonging.
*   **Connection:** Partners are encouraged to connect with customers beyond the transaction.

### 3. Core Standards of Conduct
*   **Safety & Health:** Strict adherence to food safety and workplace environment standards.
*   **Appearance:** A balance between personal expression and professional representation (the iconic green apron).
*   **Conflict of Interest:** Clear boundaries on gifts, secondary employment, and using Starbucks resources.

### 4. Benefits as Policy
*   **College Achievement Plan:** 100% tuition coverage through Arizona State University.
*   **Mental Health:** Access to Headspace and Lyra health for all partners.
