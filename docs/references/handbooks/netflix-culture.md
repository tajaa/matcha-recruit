# Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility

## Core Principles

### 1. The Dream Team
*   **Performance:** Netflix operates like a professional sports team, not a family. They hire high performers and expect excellence.
*   **Values:** Selflessness, judgment, candor, creativity, courage, inclusion, curiosity, and resilience.
*   **The Keeper Test:** Managers ask: "If this person wanted to leave, would I fight to keep them?" If not, they get a generous severance.

### 2. People Over Process
*   **Freedom:** Employees are empowered to make decisions. Rule-following is discouraged in favor of good judgment.
*   **Context, Not Control:** Managers provide the context (goals, strategy) and let the "informed captains" (the people doing the work) make the call.
*   **Disagreement:** Seeking diverse opinions and "farming for dissent" is required before major commitments.

### 3. Uncomfortably Exciting
*   **Ambition:** Focus on bold, global impact.
*   **Adaptability:** Constant evolution is expected.
*   **Artistic Expression:** Supporting content that might challenge personal values if it serves the audience.

### 4. Great and Always Better
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The culture is never "finished." New employees are expected to improve it.
